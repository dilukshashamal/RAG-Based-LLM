Introduction\\nBiometrics is a set of technologies in which unique human physi-\\nological or behavioral traits are employed to establish strong access-\\ncontrol systems that fulfill the need for secure authentication and\\nverification of individuals. By using biometric characteristics such as\\nfingerprints, iris patterns, facial features, voice characteristics, and\\nDNA, biometric systems can ensure reliable and secure identification\\nof an individual, eliminating the need for traditional methods such as\\npasswords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or smart cards. With\\nthe rapid development of information and communication technology,\\nbiometric technologies are in increasingly high demand for a wide\\nvariety of applications [ 1–3].\\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a computing paradigm com-\\nprising a distributed network of devices that can sense physical prop-\\nerties and collect, process, or exchange data over the Internet.

Recent studies, such as that of Yang et al. [ 8], have found that\\nbiometric authentication offers improved security and usability in IoT\\nenvironments. Biometric traits provide a highly accurate and reliable\\nway to verify an individual’s identity [ 9,10]. This makes biometric\\nauthentication an attractive solution for preventing identity theft, pro-\\ntecting against unauthorized access, and preventing data breaches in\\nIoT systems.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2024.103748', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Awad et al.\\nFig. 1. Schematic Venn diagram illustrating the intersections of the AI, biometrics, and\\nIoT domains, showing the core of this review.\\nThe application of biometrics in IoT systems also offers benefits\\nbeyond security: it provides convenience and usability for the users of\\nsuch systems. Biometric traits are inherent to individuals, eliminating\\nthe need to remember complex passwords or other complicated authen-\\ntication schemes. This provides a seamless and user-friendly experience,\\nencouraging widespread adoption of biometrics in IoT ecosystems.\\nIncorporating biometrics into IoT systems can help to address pri-\\nvacy concerns. Biometric authentication is privacy-preserving, and its\\ntemplates and generated hashes can be securely stored and processed\\nlocally on IoT devices, as noted by Yang et al. [ 9] and Hussain and\\nChaudhry [ 11]. This reduces the risks associated with centralized\\ndatabases and their increased potential for unauthorized access to\\npersonal information.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a set of highly transformative tech-\\nnologies that is currently revolutionizing a diverse variety of sectors.\\nAs a result, ensuring robust security measures has become increas-\\ningly crucial. The evolution of authentication measures from traditional\\npasswords and cryptographic keys to advanced authentication tech-\\nniques has ensured accessible, secure, and more reliable means of data\\nprotection. Therefore, it is evident that there is a growing interest\\nin integrating AI into biometrics and the IoT to improve the overall\\nsecurity posture and preserve data privacy [ 12,13].\\nAI algorithms can play a key role in enhancing biometric systems in\\ngeneral, and in IoT applications in particular. Integrating AI techniques\\nsuch as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) into biometric\\nauthentication can improve its accuracy and adaptability [ 14]. As noted\\nby Jiang et al. [ 15], AI algorithms enable advanced pattern recognition,\\nanomaly detection, and adaptive decision-making, allowing IoT users\\nand devices to perform authentication more efficiently and securely.\\nThis report closes a research gap by specifically reviewing the triad\\nof AI, biometrics, and the IoT, highlighting the importance of biomet-\\nrics in improving security, authentication, and the user experience in\\nIoT systems and applications. The review focuses only on two biometric\\nmodalities – fingerprints and facial recognition – as these are the two\\nmost common and convenient biometric identifiers [ 3,16]. By address-\\ning challenges and exploring opportunities, this review contributes to\\nthe development of secure and trustworthy biometrics-integrated IoT\\nsystems powered with AI to achieve enhanced security and reliability.\\nThe review starts by providing a comprehensive overview of the\\nbackground relating to biometric technologies and the IoT, discussing\\nthe need for IoT security and the importance of effective authentication.\\nNext, biometrics and its relevance to IoT security are introduced,emphasizing its benefits. A discussion is also presented regarding the\\nway in which AI – when integrated into biometrics – provides great\\nadvantages for IoT security. Furthermore, the paper presents the contri-\\nbutions of research in this area to addressing current IoT-based security\\nchallenges, improving user authentication through biometrics and AI,\\nand exploring potential solutions. Finally, descriptive and exploratory\\nanalyses of the findings are presented to determine useful relations\\nbetween biometric methods and algorithms for biometric detection,\\nrecognition, and performance-evaluation metrics.\\nThis work supports the development and advancement of the three\\naspects of a triad – AI, biometrics, and the IoT – and their new\\ninterdisciplinary domain of opportunities. By examining AI-powered\\nand -enhanced biometrics for the IoT, this review seeks to illuminate\\nthe advances and possibilities in this area that can improve security,\\nprivacy, and the user experience in the rapidly expanding world of the\\nIoT.\\n1.1.

It offers insights into the current contributions,\\nchallenges, and future trends in this field, paving the way for further\\nresearch and development in this area. A schematic showing the scope\\nof the review and the intersections of the AI, biometrics, and IoT\\ndomains is shown in Fig. 1. The main contributions of this paper can\\nbe summarized by the following points.\\n•Comprehensive analysis.

Related reviews\\nRecently, research on the use of biometrics as a reliable access-\\ncontrol mechanism in IoT systems for enhancing security and acces-\\nsibility through the application of various AI techniques has gained\\ntraction. Biometric data such as fingerprints and facial features are\\ncommonly employed to meet the requirements for establishing secure\\nIoT platforms aided by AI. Consequently, the convergence of these\\nthree sectors holds tremendous potential for notable advances and ex-\\nploratory opportunities. Table 1 provides an overview of the previously\\npublished articles in this domain and highlights the areas and sub-areas\\nthey have covered that are related to the scope of our review.\\nThe review by Yang et al. [ 8] comprehensively explores the use\\nof biometrics for enhancing security in the IoT, particularly regarding\\nauthentication and encryption. It provides insights into the current\\nstatus of biometric-based authentication and biometric-based crypto-\\ngraphic systems, identifies implementation challenges, and highlights\\nthe advantages of using biometrics in IoT systems. However, it lacks\\nan in-depth exploration of the interdependencies of the two domains.The work of Tomicic et al. [ 17] offers an overview of the soft bio-\\nmetric characteristics applicable to the IoT domain. It underscores\\nthe significance of integrating biometrics into the development of\\nIoT devices and explores various soft biometric traits encompassing\\nphysical, behavioral, and environmental factors. The study suggests\\npotential applications such as authentication, identification, and track-\\ning within the IoT. However, it lacks an in-depth analysis of specific\\nsoft biometric traits and their implementation challenges; its focus on\\nsoft biometrics also limits the exploration of other relevant biometric\\nmodalities. Gayathri et al. [ 18] also provide a comprehensive review of\\nvarious biometric techniques and their applications in the field of the\\nIoT. Nonetheless, this lacks in-depth analysis and discussion of security\\nissues and application areas, and there is also no discussion of the use\\nof AI for improving biometric authentication in IoT-based applications.\\nJunaid et al. [ 19] examine in depth the intersection of AI, sensors,\\nand vital health signs. However, their review has limited coverage\\nof other biometric aspects, and it has some shortcomings in terms\\nof providing a comprehensive analysis. A focus on biometric systems\\nbased on iris-image processing is given by Khoirunnisaa et al. [ 20],\\nalthough this lacks a broader perspective on other biometric modalities\\nand their integration with the IoT. A report by Xue et al. [ 21] presents\\na biometric-based authentication scheme for IoT-device identity. How-\\never, a potential drawback of this work is its lack of extensive analysis\\nof potential security challenges of the proposed scheme and its limita-\\ntions.

However,\\nthe potential drawbacks of this work include its limited coverage of\\nimplementation challenges and its lack of detailed analysis of specific\\nauthentication techniques.\\nThe review of Mukhopadhyay et al. [24] focuses on AI-based sensors\\nfor IoT applications. However, this appears to overlook the specific\\nrole of biometrics in enhancing security and authentication in IoT\\nsystems. Zhang et al. [25] provide an in-depth overview of biometric\\nsystems, their characteristics, solutions, and future insights. However,\\nas an editorial piece, it lacks the depth of analysis found in research-\\nfocused papers. Although Ross et al. [26] briefly discuss digital forensic\\nschemes for biometric data in smart cities in their review, this does not\\nexplore broader aspects of biometric security and its integration with\\nthe IoT.\\nThe review of Karthick et al. [27] addresses the challenges of\\nbiomedical instruments using the IoT; nonetheless, this work lacks\\nan extensive analysis of biometric authentication techniques and their\\napplication in healthcare IoT scenarios. Moradi et al. [28] presents\\na review on the improvements in the security level of IoT systems\\nprovided by the use of biometric features. However, this suffers from\\nlimitations in terms of discussing specific implementation challenges\\nand potential vulnerabilities. Similarly, Chawla [29] explore the inter-\\nsection of AI, the IoT, and wearable technology in smart healthcare,\\nbut they do not cover the specific role of biometrics in ensuring secure\\nhealthcare applications in detail. Another similar paper is presented\\nby Mariani et al. [30], who explore the application of AI in consumer\\nand marketing research involving the application of wearables based on\\nthe IoT. They also discuss the role of biometrics in the security of IoT-\\nbased devices and the role of AI in enhancing security features through\\nbiometrics; hence, providing an AI-based point of view while stating\\nexamples of biometric applications in the field of the IoT.\\nFernández-Caramés and Fraga-Lamas [31] discuss the integration\\nof IoT technologies into clothing and textiles, exploring the sensors\\ninvolved and their applications, along with the challenges and op-\\nportunities involved in creating intelligent connected e-textiles. Such\\nclothing uses an integration of biometrics into the IoT while briefly\\ninvolving the application of AI.\\nThe application of AI to recognizing physiological characteristics in\\nIoT authentication is explored by Zhang et al. [32]. This article focuses\\non the integration of AI techniques to establish personalized authentica-\\ntion based on distinct physiological characteristics such as fingerprints,\\nfacial features, and heart-rate patterns. This strategy presents a ro-\\nbust authentication approach that is aligned with the dynamic natureof the IoT. However, the study’s limitations include potential data-\\navailability constraints for AI model training, inadequate investigation\\nof ethical and bias-related considerations in physiological recogni-\\ntion, and a lack of comprehensive analysis concerning scalability and\\npractical-deployment challenges in IoT authentication.\\nIn contrast, Liang et al. [33] focus on the dynamic landscape of\\nuser-authentication challenges. They discuss continuous monitoring\\nand analysis of distinctive behavioral patterns exhibited by individ-\\nuals, encompassing keystrokes, touch gestures, and voice patterns,\\nthereby presenting a resilient authentication mechanism. By harnessing\\nAI techniques such as ML and deep neural networks (DNNs), their\\nresearch probes the adaptive potential of behavioral biometrics to\\naddress evolving usage patterns and to enhance security within the IoT\\nera. Notably, the limitations of this study include potential restrictions\\narising from dataset availability, a requirement for a more thorough\\ninvestigation of privacy concerns, and an emphasis on technical aspects\\nthat may overshadow practical-implementation hurdles and emerging\\ntechnologies.\\nIn summary, although the review papers discussed in this section\\ndelve into various facets of AI, biometrics, and the IoT, they each ex-\\nhibit distinct limitations; these limitations include a constrained scope,\\na lack of thorough analysis, or an oversight of specific subdomains\\nwithin the expansive realm of biometrics and the IoT. Consequently,\\nour review distinguishes itself by its relevance and distinctiveness. Our\\nreview is dedicated to delivering a meticulous and all-encompassing\\nanalysis of the interconnected domains of AI, biometrics, and the\\nIoT. It delves into their scope, presents comprehensive solutions, and\\nanticipates future trajectories while elucidating the interplay between\\nthese three pivotal domains.\\n3.

Awad et al.\\n4.1. Biometric technologies\\nBiometrics has achieved widespread prominence as a reliable and\\nsecure access-control method that offers individual authentication and\\nidentification. Biometric solutions have been widely deployed across\\nthe IoT, primarily due to their remarkable ability to accurately identify\\nindividuals. As noted, these approaches are based on distinctive physi-\\nological or behavioral characteristics that are unique to each person,\\nsuch as fingerprints, iris patterns, and facial features, making this a\\nhighly reliable method of verification when compared to traditional\\napproaches [34]. Notably, the use of biometrics has proven particularly\\neffective in fortifying security in IoT systems [35].\\nBiometric technologies include fingerprint scanning, facial recogni-\\ntion, iris scanning, and voice recognition; using these technologies, the\\nunique traits of individuals can be used to identify them [36]. Of these\\nmethods, fingerprint scanning and facial recognition are frequently\\nused because of their high accuracy and differentiation capabilities.\\nAuthentication – the process of confirming someone’s identity when\\nthey are accessing a system or service – has increasingly embraced\\nbiometrics as a more secure and more reliable alternative to tra-\\nditional methods such as passwords [37]. Consequently, biometric\\nauthentication has found extensive applications in industries such as\\nfinance, healthcare, and government, safeguarding sensitive data and\\ntransactions.\\nKey biometric-identification technologies include fingerprint, iris,\\nfacial, and voice recognition, and behavioral biometrics. Fingerprint\\nrecognition involves scanning and analyzing unique patterns on the\\nfingers of a person to confirm their identity [37]. Iris recognition, which\\nis typically based on near-infrared (NIR) light, captures a distinct image\\nof the colored part of a person’s eye; this offers high reliability and\\nprecision, and it is commonly used in airport security and immigration\\nprocedures [20].\\nFacial recognition uses AI and ML algorithms to detect facial fea-\\ntures and identify individuals based on their unique characteristics [38].\\nIt is widely used by law-enforcement agencies and at airports. Voice\\nrecognition involves analyzing the distinct voice patterns of a person to\\nidentify them [39]; it is commonly used in telephone-banking systems\\nand other authenticated services. Behavioral biometrics, on the other\\nhand, tracks human performance patterns such as their typing speed,\\nthe way in which they write their signature, their keystroke dynam-\\nics, and their mouse movements for identity verification [40]; these\\napproaches are frequently employed in the banking and e-commerce\\nsectors.\\nBiometric-capture technologies thus offer reliable and secure ways\\nto identify individuals. Each type of biometric technology possesses\\nunique strengths and weaknesses, making each suitable for different\\napplications. The significance of biometrics for enhancing security for\\nsafeguarding sensitive data and transactions is evident across various\\nsectors.\\nAmong multiple possibilities, the most commonly used biometric\\ntraits in the field of authentication are facial and fingerprint fea-\\ntures [41]. Facial recognition stands out as a prominent biometric au-\\nthentication method due to its non-intrusive nature and the widespread\\navailability of cameras on various devices [3]. AI-based facial-recogni-\\ntion algorithms analyze facial features such as the distance between the\\neyes, the shape of the nose, and the contour of the jawline to create a\\nunique facial template for each individual. These templates are then\\nused to distinguish and verify identities. Facial recognition is widely\\nused in a variety of sectors to identify and distinguish individuals for\\nsecurity purposes; it is also used on smartphones to securely unlock\\ndevices [41–43].\\nFingerprint recognition is one of the oldest and most widely used\\nbiometric technologies for authentication [1,44]. It involves capturing\\nand analyzing the unique patterns and ridges on a person’s fingers to\\nconfirm their identity. Fingerprint recognition is highly accurate and\\nhas a low FAR, making it a preferred choice in applications that requirea high level of security [45]. It is commonly used in smartphones,\\nlaptops, and other devices for user authentication, as well as in access-\\ncontrol systems for buildings and sensitive areas [46]. The optimization\\nof fingerprint analysis and classification is crucial for improving the\\nperformance of biometric systems, forensic investigations, and other\\nfingerprint-based applications.\\nThe continuous advancement of AI and the integration of biometrics\\ninto the IoT is expected to further enhance the capabilities and applica-\\ntions of facial- and fingerprint-recognition technologies, making them\\neven more reliable and secure for various authentication purposes.\\n4.2. IoT\\nThe IoT is a network of interconnected devices that include embed-\\nded sensors, software, and other technologies to collect and exchange\\ndata [47]. IoT devices comprise a broad spectrum, ranging from basic\\nsensors to intricate machines or systems. With the proliferation of the\\nIoT, ensuring the security and privacy of these devices has become a\\nsignificant concern. This section provides an overview of the IoT, IoT\\nsecurity, and IoT authentication.\\nThe IoT has gained immense popularity and is being widely used in\\nvarious industries, including healthcare, transportation, manufacturing,\\nand smart homes [48]. The use of IoT devices has led to the creation\\nof vast amounts of data, which can be analyzed for insights and to\\nimprove efficiencies. However, this also presents challenges for security\\nand privacy [49,50].\\nIoT security refers to the measures taken to protect IoT devices\\nand networks from cyber threats, such as malware, hacking, and unau-\\nthorized access [51]. IoT devices are often vulnerable and can be\\nattacked due to their limited computing resources and weak or default\\npasswords.\\nAuthentication is a fundamental aspect of IoT security, as it ensures\\nthat only authorized users and devices can access the network [52].\\nAuthentication is used to verify the identity of users and devices using\\none or more credentials, such as passwords, tokens, or digital certifi-\\ncates. Authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to devices and\\nIoT networks.\\nThere are several challenges in implementing effective authentica-\\ntion in IoT devices and networks. Authentication mechanisms must be\\ntailored to the specific constraints of IoT devices, such as constrained\\nprocessing power and memory [53]. The use of strong authentication\\ntechniques, such as biometrics, can provide a more secure and conve-\\nnient alternative to traditional authentication methods [35]. King and\\nAwad [54] proposed a distributed security mechanism that effectively\\nmanages and mitigates potential security threats, even in devices with\\nlimited processing power, memory, and energy resources. By strate-\\ngically distributing security tasks and responsibilities, this mechanism\\noptimizes the use of available resources while maintaining a high level\\nof security; through a combination of innovative techniques, such as\\nlightweight cryptography and efficient communication protocols, it\\naims to protect IoT devices from unauthorized access, data breaches,\\nand other potential cyber threats. This work contributes to the ad-\\nvancement of secure IoT deployment in resource-constrained settings,\\nhighlighting the importance of tailored security solutions to safeguard\\nthe expanding IoT ecosystem.\\nIn general, the growth of the IoT has created new challenges for\\nsecurity and privacy. IoT security must be addressed to ensure the\\nprotection of IoT devices and the data they generate. Authentication\\nplays a crucial role in IoT security and must be implemented effectively\\nto provide secure access control.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Awad et al.\\n4.3. Biometrics for reliable IoT security\\nBiometric technologies have emerged as a promising solution for\\nimproving user security and authentication in IoT devices. By using the\\nunique physiological or behavioral characteristics of individuals, bio-\\nmetrics offers reliable and secure methods to identify and authenticate\\nusers and devices in various application domains.\\nIn the era of the IoT, user authentication is crucial to ensuring\\nthe security of connected devices. Traditional authentication methods\\nand conventional biometrics-based approaches, such as facial and fin-\\ngerprint recognition and passwords, are vulnerable to various attacks.\\nHowever, the powerful sensing capabilities of IoT devices such as smart\\nwearables and smartphones enable the use of behavioral biometrics\\nfor continuous authentication. As already noted, behavioral biometrics\\nuses unique patterns of human activity, such as physical movements\\ncaptured by smartphone sensors, to recognize users [55].\\nBiometrics in IoT security can be classified into two important\\ncategories: authentication and encryption. Yang et al. [8] discussed\\nand classified contemporary biometric-based authentication systems\\nfor the IoT based on different biometric traits and the number of\\nbiometric traits employed in the system. They also reviewed and dis-\\ncussed biometric-cryptographic systems, which integrate biometrics\\nwith cryptography, as a means to enhance security in the IoT. These\\nsystems leverage unique characteristics of biometric-capture devices\\nand cryptographic techniques to provide enhanced security for IoT\\ndevices [56].\\nLiao et al. [57] sought to identify the security vulnerabilities,\\nthreats, and risks associated with IoT devices and proposed solutions\\nto enhance the security and privacy of IoT systems. Their article dis-\\ncusses various challenges, such as attacks, vulnerabilities, and privacy\\nconcerns, and provides information about countermeasures to mitigate\\nthese security issues. The results of their literature review provide\\na comprehensive analysis of security challenges in the IoT and give\\nvaluable information about countermeasures to improve IoT security.\\nThe application of biometrics in the IoT extends beyond security.\\nAs noted, biometric devices can capture physiological or behavioral fea-\\ntures of individuals, and these data can be further processed using cloud\\ncomputing to verify or identify users [58]. In addition to authentication\\nand security, biometrics can be used for personalized AI services, such\\nas AI secretaries, by analyzing individual speaker data.\\nIntegrating biometrics into IoT systems involves several mechanisms\\nthat enable secure and reliable authentication and cryptographic op-\\nerations. One such mechanism is the use of biometric-capture devices\\nembedded in IoT devices, which capture and process biometric data.\\nThese devices can include fingerprint scanners, iris- and facial-capture\\ndevices, voice-capturing microphones, and other wearable biometric-\\ncapture devices [8].\\nDhillon and Kalra [59] addressed the critical demand for robust\\nauthentication mechanisms; amid the proliferation of IoT applications,\\ntheir paper innovatively presents a multi-factor authentication scheme,\\nprominently featuring biometric elements, to increase the security and\\nreliability of remote user authentication. Emphasizing the limitations of\\nconventional methods, the study integrates biometric identifiers such as\\nfingerprints and facial features to enhance user-identification accuracy\\nand bolster trust in the authentication process. Through a meticulously\\ndesigned framework, which couples biometric factors with passwords\\nor tokens, the scheme establishes a multi-layered security approach to\\nprotect against unauthorized access. The outcomes of this research un-\\nderscore the scheme’s effectiveness in fortifying remote-user-access se-\\ncurity within IoT settings, propelling advances in securing interactions\\nacross the expansive and interconnected IoT landscape.\\nBiometric-based user authentication is a crucial aspect of IoT secu-\\nrity; it ensures that only authorized users can access IoT devices and\\nservices [60]. The security of user authentication can be enhanced us-\\ning biometric traits such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features.\\nBiometric templates are captured during enrollment and comparedwith the user’s biometric data during authentication. This process\\nprovides a more secure and more convenient alternative to traditional\\nauthentication methods, such as passwords or PINs [61].\\nBiometric-based cryptography is another mechanism that uses bio-\\nmetrics in IoT systems. This combines the unique biometric traits of\\nindividuals with cryptographic algorithms to improve data security\\nand privacy [8]. Biometric-based cryptographic systems use biometric\\nkeys derived from a user’s biometric traits to encrypt and decrypt\\ndata. This ensures that only authorized individuals with the correct\\nbiometric traits can access the encrypted data, adding an extra layer\\nof protection [62].\\n4.3.1. Application domains of biometrics in the IoT\\nBiometrics has found applications in various IoT domains, including\\nsmart homes, industrial automation, transportation, and agriculture.\\nThe development of the IoT has paved the way for smart environments,\\ngadgets, and other applications in our daily lives. Biometrics provides\\nsecurity for access control, personalized services, and seamless user\\nexperiences in these domains. We will now shed light on two specific\\napplication domains: healthcare and smart cities.\\n•Healthcare. In healthcare, biometrics can improve patient iden-\\ntification and the control of access to medical records, enabling\\nsecure authentication for healthcare professionals. For example,\\nbiometric authentication can be used to ensure that only autho-\\nrized healthcare providers can access electronic health records,\\nthereby enhancing patient privacy and data security [63,64].\\nBiometric security measures such as facial and fingerprint recog-\\nnition are increasingly being used to ensure patient safety in\\nhealthcare organizations. These measures are effective for ac-\\ncurately verifying patient identity, preventing unauthorized ac-\\ncess to medical records and hospital data and maintaining the\\naccuracy and safety of patient data [65].\\nIn the field of healthcare, there have also been studies on the\\nuse of iris-recognition systems to detect a person’s fitness for\\nduty. These systems can analyze NIR-range iris images to identify\\nchanges in iris behavior that may be indicative of impairment due\\nto sleepiness, or alcohol or drug consumption. By detecting such\\nimpairments, such systems can help to ensure that individuals\\nare capable of performing their daily tasks safely. This is particu-\\nlarly important in scenarios involving heavy machinery, where\\nimpaired individuals can cause work-related accidents and put\\nlives at risk [66,67].\\n•Smart cities. Biometrics plays a vital role in smart-city appli-\\ncations, including for secure access control to smart buildings,\\nintelligent transportation systems, and public safety. Biometric\\ntechnologies can be employed for efficient and secure identifica-\\ntion and authentication in these environments, ensuring that only\\nauthorized individuals have access to data, physical facilities, and\\ncritical resources and services [48].\\nFacilities that use fingerprint-, palm-print-, or facial-recognition\\ntechnologies can be used to verify the identities of individuals,\\nensuring authorized access to buildings, transportation systems,\\nand other facilities. Furthermore, digital systems in smart cities\\ncan now be equipped with biometrics integrated into payment\\nsystems to authorize financial transactions, providing a secure\\nand convenient way for residents to make purchases or access\\nservices [26,68].\\nIn summary, the integration of biometrics into the IoT offers ex-\\nciting opportunities for enhanced security and personalized experi-\\nences. Mechanisms such as biometric-based user authentication and\\nbiometric-based cryptography can strengthen the security of IoT sys-\\ntems. Additionally, biometric technologies can be applied in various\\ndomains, including healthcare and smart cities, enabling secure access\\ncontrol and personalized services.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

AI for robust biometrics\\nAdvanced biometric authentication technologies are increasingly\\nbeing combined with AI and ML algorithms, leading to enhanced\\nsecurity and privacy for IoT systems. These AI-enabled technologies\\nplay a vital role in accurately verifying authorized users and detect-\\ning malicious activities within some IoT systems. The integration of\\nAI into biometrics is often referred to as intelligent or AI-powered\\nbiometrics [69]. One significant contribution to AI-powered biomet-\\nric authentication is the use of a combination of multiple biometric\\nfeatures, resulting in multi-layered security. This fusion of multiple\\nbiometric traits can be used to provide robust authentication protocols\\nthat reduce the risk of errors and decrease FARs [62]. There has also\\nbeen a growing trend toward AI-powered behavioral biometrics, an\\napproach that provides a more comprehensive solution to biometric\\nauthentication. As discussed above, behavioral biometrics analyses user\\nbehavior to detect any anomalous activity that may indicate unau-\\nthorized access. Unlike traditional biometric approaches that require\\none-time authentication, AI-based algorithms can continuously monitor\\nuser behavior. This technology is currently used in the financial and\\nbanking industries to monitor user behavior during online transactions,\\nhelping to prevent fraud and illegal activities [18].\\nThe scope of using AI to improve biometric systems is massive,\\nand numerous potential applications have not yet been explored. AI\\ntechniques such as ML and DL are playing critical roles in detecting ma-\\nlicious activities in IoT systems. The use of AI will become increasingly\\nvital in biometric authentication mechanisms to combat more sophisti-\\ncated and increasingly complex cyber threats and attacks, presentation\\nattacks, and software-related attacks [70]. With the widespread adop-\\ntion of IoT systems, AI in biometric technologies is expected to become\\nmore advanced and effective, providing new solutions to the challenges\\nassociated with traditional access-control methods [33,71,72].\\nAI-powered biometric technologies have diverse application poten-\\ntial and have had wide-ranging impacts across multiple industries.\\nFacial- and fingerprint-recognition systems have been increasingly\\nadopted within the security sector, while behavioral biometrics have\\nvast applications in the financial industry, primarily for detecting\\nfraudulent activities. The healthcare and transportation industries have\\nalso recently adopted AI in biometric technologies. For example, facial\\nrecognition is used in the healthcare industry to identify patients\\nand reduce errors in treatment. As transportation systems become\\nmore complex, biometric authentication technologies are being used\\nto identify the drivers of commercial vehicles, and they have also had\\na positive impact on autonomous-driving applications [33].\\nFrom the work reviewed so far, it is apparent that AI-powered\\nbiometric technologies have revolutionized traditional authentication\\nmechanisms and provided advanced security and privacy solutions to\\nIoT systems. Authors such as Smith and Miller [73] have addressed\\ncrucial ethical considerations related to the deployment of biometric\\nfacial-recognition technology. Their study underscored the significance\\nof ethical practices, transparency, privacy protection, and bias miti-\\ngation when integrating AI-enhanced facial-recognition systems into\\nbiometric applications. Furthermore, the trend toward behavioral bio-\\nmetrics is growing, and the market for behavior biometrics is expected\\nto exceed US $11 billion by 2031 [74]. The scope of AI in biometric\\ntechnologies is also expected to continue to expand, becoming more\\nadvanced and effective with the adoption of increasing numbers of IoT\\nsystems, providing unique solutions to the challenges associated with\\ntraditional authentication methods.\\n4.5. The need for AI-powered biometrics in the IoT\\nThe convergence of AI, biometrics, and the IoT has ushered in a new\\nera of enhanced security and personalized experiences. This section\\nfocuses on the applications of biometrics in the IoT and the integrationof AI and biometrics, with a specific focus on facial and fingerprint\\nrecognition.\\nIntegrating biometrics into the IoT opens up novel possibilities\\nfor increased security and personalized experiences across various ap-\\nplications. IoT devices, leveraging their interconnected nature and\\ndata-gathering capabilities, can derive significant benefits from biomet-\\nric authentication methods. By incorporating biometric identifiers such\\nas fingerprints, iris patterns, facial features, and voice patterns into IoT\\nsystems, seamless and secure user identification can be achieved within\\nthe IoT ecosystem [8].\\nAI has been a game-changer in the field of biometrics, particularly\\nin the fields of facial and fingerprint recognition. AI-driven facial-\\nrecognition systems have made substantial strides, enabling accurate\\nand efficient identification of individuals from images or video feeds.\\nThese systems use DL algorithms to analyze facial features, such as\\neye distance, nose shape, and other unique characteristics, to create\\nindividualized facial templates [38]. The integration of AI into facial\\nrecognition in IoT devices facilitates real-time identification, making it\\nvaluable in applications such as access control and surveillance.\\nSimilarly, AI has revolutionized fingerprint recognition. AI algo-\\nrithms can be used to adeptly extract and analyze minutiae points on\\nfingerprints, which are distinct to each individual, ensuring reliable\\nand secure authentication. The incorporation of AI into fingerprint-\\nrecognition systems has substantially improved their accuracy and\\nspeed, positioning this as an ideal biometric authentication method for\\nIoT devices [75].\\nThe integration of AI into biometrics for IoT security delivers sig-\\nnificant advantages. AI algorithms can continuously learn and adapt\\nfrom data collected by IoT devices, enhancing the overall performance\\nand accuracy of the recognition of biometric traits.

Recently, increasing numbers of peo-\\nple are becoming multi-device users, interacting with multiple\\nsmart devices [33]. The complexity of multi-device, multi-user\\ninteraction presents significant challenges for cross-device au-\\nthentication.

Awad et al.\\n•Emerging malicious attacks on biometrics-based authentication. Most\\nauthentication systems based on behavioral biometrics are pro-\\ntotypes evaluated in a constrained laboratory environment with\\nlimited numbers of participants. Comprehensive evaluations with\\nlarge numbers of participants are needed to investigate the per-\\nformance of existing behavior-based authentication systems when\\nthey are faced with potential attacks. Moreover, IoT systems are\\nfaced with numerous security threats in the physical, protocol,\\ncommunication, and application layers [118]. For example, in\\na low-power wireless network, an energy-depletion attack can\\nrapidly drain the batteries of devices by forcing sensors or actu-\\nators to execute energy-intensive tasks. Consequently, an entire\\nnetwork could fail due to battery exhaustion [119]. Thermal\\nattacks rely on the heat transferred from users to interactive\\ndevices and exploit heat traces in the wake of user interaction\\nwith devices to uncover the entered credentials [120]. In the\\ncommunication layer, heterogeneous communication protocols\\nare subject to attacks such as eavesdropping, sinkhole, hello flood,\\nand collision [121]. AI is widely applied by imposters to hack\\nauthentication and identification systems. For example, AI has\\nbeen maliciously used by imposters to speculate passwords [33].\\n•Security and privacy challenges. Biometric authentication systems\\nface challenges such as spoofing attacks, template protection,\\nand secure storage of biometric data [10,17,24,26]. Privacy con-\\ncerns arise when personal biometric data is collected and pro-\\ncessed in IoT environments [8,20]. Striking a balance between\\nusability and privacy is crucial [42]. To overcome these chal-\\nlenges, privacy-preserving mechanisms and regulatory frame-\\nworks should be used to safeguard user data and privacy.\\n•Usability and user experience. Combinations of biometric systems\\nwith AI and the IoT should strive for higher accuracy and effi-\\nciency [8,14,21]. Improving algorithms and leveraging AI tech-\\nniques can enhance recognition rates and reduce FARs and FRRs.\\nIn addition, user experience is crucial for a widespread adoption\\nand the move toward seamless integration and a user-friendly in-\\nterface. The development of intuitive interfaces and the seamless\\nintegration of biometric authentication in IoT-based devices and\\nIoT applications can overcome these challenges [14,25].\\n•Ethical and legal considerations. The collection, storage, and use\\nof biometric data raise ethical concerns [9,24]. Ensuring data\\nprivacy and adhering to ethical frameworks can help to ensure\\nthe responsible use of biometric data and minimize potential\\nbiases and discriminatory practices. Furthermore, adhering to\\nlegal regulations is crucial for the integration of AI, the IoT, and\\nbiometrics [20]. During the development of such systems, com-\\npliance with existing and emerging data-protection and privacy\\nlaws is essential to ensuring transparency and accountability.\\n•Interoperability and standardization. The integration of AI-powered\\nbiometrics into the IoT requires interoperability among different\\nsystems, devices, and platforms [11,22]. This includes the de-\\nvelopment and application of standardized protocols and frame-\\nworks to ensure seamless integration and communication be-\\ntween various IoT and biometric systems. Additionally, standard-\\nization plays a vital role in ensuring compatibility, security, and\\nreliability [17].\\n6.2. Future vision\\nThe process of the integration of AI into biometrics produces AI-\\npowered biometric systems that can be applied to enhance IoT security.\\nThis holds significant promise for the future, with numerous advances\\nand trends anticipated in various industries and applications. As an\\noutcome of the review process, we have identified the following future\\ntrends in the application of AI-powered biometrics to the IoT.•AI-powered biometric systems. Leveraging DL algorithms to extract\\nhigh-level features from biometric data will lead to improved\\naccuracy and recognition rates [8,14,21]. Explainable AI plays\\na crucial role in biometrics, enhancing transparency and trust in\\nAI-driven systems [122]. By developing explainable AI models, it\\nis possible to gain insights into how biometric algorithms make\\ndecisions based on physiological or behavioral features, providing\\nclear justifications for outcomes. This transparency is vital in crit-\\nical applications such as authentication and identification, where\\nusers need to understand the reasoning behind AI decisions.\\nFurthermore, using explainable AI helps to identify biases and\\nethical concerns, promoting fairness and ethical use of biometric\\ntechnologies [55].\\nStriking a balance between model complexity and interpretabil-\\nity remains a challenge, especially in complex AI models such\\nas those using DL [123]. Nonetheless, pursuing interpretabil-\\nity in biometrics fosters greater acceptance and ensures that\\nAI-powered biometric systems deliver reliable and trustworthy\\nresults in various domains. Continued research in explainable\\nAI will unlock the full potential of biometrics while addressing\\nconcerns and promoting ethical deployments of AI technologies.\\n•ML advances. So-called ‘‘Tiny ML’’ is the future. This involves\\ndeploying ML models on resource-constrained IoT devices, and it\\nis poised to play a significant role in this context. With advances\\nin hardware and software optimization techniques, Tiny ML is\\nexpected to become even more efficient, accurate, and accessible\\nin the future [124]. This will open up new possibilities for appli-\\ncations such as predictive maintenance in smart homes, health\\nmonitoring in wearable devices, and real-time environmental\\nmonitoring.\\nAnother technology that is currently emerging is automated ML\\n(AutoML) applications. As the volume of data grows exponen-\\ntially, the complexity of ML models and hyperparameter tuning\\nwill increase, necessitating advanced automated solutions. Au-\\ntoML, which automates the ML workflow, is expected to remain\\na powerful tool in the future of AI and ML. It will continue to\\ndemocratize AI by enabling more people to harness the power of\\nML without the need for extensive expertise [125].\\nIn various domains, including healthcare, financial services, au-\\ntonomous vehicles, and climate science, AutoML is anticipated\\nto assist in developing sophisticated models and optimizing com-\\nplex tasks. As the field evolves, AutoML techniques are likely\\nto become more sophisticated, addressing complex challenges\\nand reducing the need for extensive human intervention in the\\nmodel-development process.\\n•Advances in biometric security. Continuous monitoring and verifi-\\ncation of a user’s identity based on unique biometric traits will en-\\nhance security and mitigate the risks of unauthorized access [10,\\n17,24,26]. Furthermore, integrating multiple biometric mecha-\\nnisms, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and voice recog-\\nnition, will result in more robust and accurate authentication\\nsystems; however, such systems should not compromise usability,\\nand the implementation of such multimodal systems should only\\nbe used if required by the desired level of security [10,79].\\n•IoT-driven biometric applications. Integrations of AI, biometrics,\\nand the IoT will revolutionize a variety of applications. For in-\\nstance, healthcare services can be improved through the imple-\\nmentation of IoT systems for personalized and remote patient\\nmonitoring, early detection of diseases, and customized treatment\\nplans. Adding biometrics to IoT devices will create a strong\\nsecurity layer, which will increase the trust and user acceptability\\nof the services offered [114]. In smart homes and cities, adding\\nbiometric-capture devices will enhance security and convenience,\\nenabling seamless access control, personalized services, and ef-\\nficient resource management [49,112]. Future focus will be on\\nthe development of techniques such as secure encryption, feder-\\nated learning, and differential privacy to protect user data while\\nmaintaining acceptable usability [8,20].', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Awad et al.\\n•Standardization and interoperability. Endeavors toward standard-\\nization will establish common frameworks, protocols, and data\\nformats, ensuring seamless integration and communication among\\nAI, biometrics, and IoT systems [11,22]. Other advances that\\nemerge from AI-powered biometrics and the IoT include wear-\\nable electronics and photonics, real-time healthcare monitoring,\\nincorporation of behavioral biometrics into IoT devices for con-\\ntinuous authentication, AI-enabled threat detection and response,\\nautomated civil infrastructure, health monitoring, and intelligent\\nenergy management in smart grids [11,12,55,126–129].\\nThe deployment of IoT system has the potential to have positive\\nimpacts on various sectors, including healthcare, infrastructure\\nmonitoring, energy management, and smart cities. However, chal-\\nlenges regarding security, privacy, interoperability, and ethics\\nneed to be addressed, and AI-powered biometrics will play a vital\\nrole to this end. Overcoming these challenges has the potential to\\nresult in significant improvements in efficiency, security, privacy,\\nsafety, and quality of life.\\nThere are new trends and advances in biometric technology that\\nenhance healthcare security. These include multi-factor authen-\\ntication, which uses multiple biometric modalities such as fin-\\ngerprint scans and facial recognition. Another advance in this\\narea is continuous authentication which, a noted, is a real-time\\nmonitoring and identity-verification approach that can offer alerts\\nrelating to threats or unauthorized access to sensitive information.\\nFinally, biometric-enabled applications can be applied to apps, in-\\nhome devices, and other technologies to provide better and more\\nsecure access to patient records.\\nIt is important to note that the challenges identified herein and\\nthe future vision presented above provide opportunities for further\\nresearch aimed at either overcoming these challenges or advancing the\\napplication of AI-powered biometrics in the IoT.\\n7. Conclusion\\nThe IoT has great potential in various applications, such as au-\\ntonomous vehicles, healthcare, industry 4.0, and smart cities. However,\\ndue to the size and diversity of the data and applications, this will\\nrequire intelligent and scalable security measures. Integrating AI into\\nbiometric technologies such as fingerprint and facial recognition cre-\\nates intelligent or AI-powered biometric systems, and this in turn\\ncontributes to developing security solutions that meet IoT security\\nrequirements. In this article, we have presented a comprehensive re-\\nview examining the current literature on biometrics, intelligent or\\nAI-powered biometrics, and the IoT, focusing on different aspects and\\nchallenges associated with this integration, as well as envisioning future\\ntrends.\\nThis review has highlighted the important role of biometrics in en-\\nhancing IoT-based system security, emphasizing the need for intelligent\\nbiometrics that use AI to create AI-powered biometric-based security\\nmeasures that are suitable for the IoT. The review has also discussed\\nexciting possibilities, such as the convergence of AI, biometrics, and\\nthe IoT, the use of enhanced biometrics in IoT domains, and the\\ninterdependence of these three components.\\nAlthough there are challenges to be addressed, such as security and\\nprivacy concerns, the lack of resources in IoT devices, cross-device\\nauthentication, security attacks on AI, authentication and encryption,\\nand ethical issues, this integration has the potential to transform future\\ninnovations. Future investigations are required to address the identified\\nchallenges. By addressing these challenges, the full potential of this\\ntriad can be realized, leading to an intelligent, secure, and inter-\\nconnected future that will positively impact many aspects of human\\nlife.CRediT authorship contribution statement\\nAli Ismail Awad: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology,\\nProject administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing\\n– review & editing.
